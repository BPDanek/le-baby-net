The purpose of this repository is to track different versions of my MNIST implementation. 
MNIST is a wildly supported data set that has lots of different implementations. 
The idea is to try out the advice/implementation people reference and quanlitatively determine which 
methods are good for which applications.

The link-dump includes useful information associated with this project; if you have quesitons as to why I did something specific (ex. activation function) then refer to that document.
