# le-baby-net
leNet implementation by Benjamin Danek

The purpose of this repository is to track different versions of my MNIST implementation. 
MNIST is a wildly supported data set that has lots of different implementations. 
The idea is to try out the advice/implementation people reference and quanlitatively determine which 
methods are good for which applications.

Some of the sources I used will be referenced in a link-dump.
